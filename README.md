# Next.js Blackjack ⚠️In Development

A **Blackjack game** built with **Next.js** and **React**, featuring six-deck game logic. The UI is still in development. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to **implement a realistic Six Deck Blackjack game** that allows for **card counting** while featuring **visually appealing animations** for a good experience.  
I am also planning to add a **Leaderboard**, so authenticated users can compete.

##  Features 
- **Game Logic**: Card dealing, player actions (hit, stand, double, split), and dealer rules.
- **Multiple Decks**: Supports six-deck Blackjack with shuffle mechanics.
- **Betting System**: Players can place bets using different chip denominations.
- **Animations & UI**: Planned but not implemented yet.

##  Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React** (Frontend framework)
- **Redux** (State management)
- **Motion** (Planned for animations)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Planned for styling)
